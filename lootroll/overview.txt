Loot Roll's end goal is to simulate the loot recieved from x monster.

I will try to figure out a way to port over drop tables from the wiki into here, 
shouldn't be impossible but I have never done it.

Brainstorm:

"Enemies" have "Tables", paired with a Probability.

Some Enemies are "Unique", and have different Rolling Procedures/Orders. (Muspah, Hydra, DT2)

Every "Table" has a Probability to be rolled
Every "Table" has entires of type <"Loot", Probability>.



Every "Loot" comes with a Quantity and can be Tradeable or Untradeable. (Also GE/HA value)




Probability is of type Double <= 1.0 . Represented as fraction or decimal. eg: 10% chance = 0.1 or 1d/10d.
The Sum of Probabilites should be 1. (RDT nothing is still a drop)


Im thinking of making a huge map structure, where you can link an item 'id' to a name/image pairing.
